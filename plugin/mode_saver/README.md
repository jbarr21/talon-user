# Mode saver

Feature to enable writing of the current Talon mode to a file. This is useful for other integrations like the [Stream Deck Talon toggle](https://github.com/jbarr21/streamdeck-talon) to know the current Talon mode for display and detecting mode changes via a FileWatcher.

## Usage

You can enable this by changing the following setting in `mode_saver.talon`:
`user.mode_saver_enable = 1`
